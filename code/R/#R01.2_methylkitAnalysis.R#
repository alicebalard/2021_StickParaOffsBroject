getMethylationStats(myobj[[2]],plot=FALSE,both.strands=FALSE)

baseDB.obj <- makeMethylDB(methylBase.obj,"my/path")
mydbpath <- getDBPath(baseDB.obj)
rm(baseDB.obj)
readMethylDB(mydbpath)

dbdir = "/data/SBCS-EizaguirreLab/Alice/StickParaBroOff/Data/05MethylDB"

myobjDB = readMethylDB(dbdir)


You can also convert methylDB objects to their in-memory equivalents. Since that requires an additional parameter (the directory where the files will be located), we have a different function, named makeMethylDB to achieve this goal. Below, we convert a methylBase object to methylBaseDB and saving it at “exMethylDB” directory.

objDB=makeMethylDB(methylBase.obj,"exMethylDB")
