gasAcul06841-RA,PER2,O15055,intergenerational,Gy_chrI,promoters,"FUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor which forms a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndrome and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. PER1 and PER2 proteins transport CRY1 and CRY2 into the nucleus with appropriate circadian timing, but also contribute directly to repression of clock-controlled target genes through interaction with several classes of RNA-binding proteins, helicases and others transcriptional repressors. PER appears to regulate circadian control of transcription by at least three different modes. First, interacts directly with the CLOCK-BMAL1 at the tail end of the nascent transcript peak to recruit complexes containing the SIN3-HDAC that remodel chromatin to repress transcription. Second, brings H3K9 methyltransferases such as SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 to the E-box elements of the circadian target genes, like PER2 itself or PER1. The recruitment of each repressive modifier to the DNA seems to be very precisely temporally orchestrated by the large PER complex, the deacetylases acting before than the methyltransferases. Additionally, large PER complexes are also recruited to the target genes 3' termination site through interactions with RNA-binding proteins and helicases that may play a role in transcription termination to regulate transcription independently of CLOCK-BMAL1 interactions. Recruitment of large PER complexes to the elongating polymerase at PER and CRY termination sites inhibited SETX action, impeding RNA polymerase II release and thereby repressing transcriptional reinitiation. May propagate clock information to metabolic pathways via the interaction with nuclear receptors. Coactivator of PPARA and corepressor of NR1D1, binds rhythmically at the promoter of nuclear receptors target genes like BMAL1 or G6PC1. Directly and specifically represses PPARG proadipogenic activity by blocking PPARG recruitment to target promoters and thereby inhibiting transcriptional activation. Required for fatty acid and lipid metabolism, is involved as well in the regulation of circulating insulin levels. Plays an important role in the maintenance of cardiovascular functions through the regulation of NO and vasodilatatory prostaglandins production in aortas. Controls circadian glutamate uptake in synaptic vesicles through the regulation of VGLUT1 expression. May also be involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes. Represses the CLOCK-BMAL1 induced transcription of BHLHE40/DEC1 and ATF4. Negatively regulates the formation of the TIMELESS-CRY1 complex by competing with TIMELESS for binding to CRY1. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O54943}."

gasAcul08770-RA,SMARCA4,A7Z019,intergenerational,Gy_chrIX,introns,"FUNCTION: Involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA-nucleosome topology). Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating the calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and the recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by SMARCA4-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves the release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development, a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self-renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity). Acts as a corepressor of ZEB1 to regulate E-cadherin transcription and is required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by ZEB1.

gasAcul05636-RA,PER2,O15055,interaction,Gy_chrVII,exons,"FUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor which forms a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndrome and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. PER1 and PER2 proteins transport CRY1 and CRY2 into the nucleus with appropriate circadian timing, but also contribute directly to repression of clock-controlled target genes through interaction with several classes of RNA-binding proteins, helicases and others transcriptional repressors. PER appears to regulate circadian control of transcription by at least three different modes. First, interacts directly with the CLOCK-BMAL1 at the tail end of the nascent transcript peak to recruit complexes containing the SIN3-HDAC that remodel chromatin to repress transcription. Second, brings H3K9 methyltransferases such as SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 to the E-box elements of the circadian target genes, like PER2 itself or PER1. The recruitment of each repressive modifier to the DNA seems to be very precisely temporally orchestrated by the large PER complex, the deacetylases acting before than the methyltransferases. Additionally, large PER complexes are also recruited to the target genes 3' termination site through interactions with RNA-binding proteins and helicases that may play a role in transcription termination to regulate transcription independently of CLOCK-BMAL1 interactions. Recruitment of large PER complexes to the elongating polymerase at PER and CRY termination sites inhibited SETX action, impeding RNA polymerase II release and thereby repressing transcriptional reinitiation. May propagate clock information to metabolic pathways via the interaction with nuclear receptors. Coactivator of PPARA and corepressor of NR1D1, binds rhythmically at the promoter of nuclear receptors target genes like BMAL1 or G6PC1. Directly and specifically represses PPARG proadipogenic activity by blocking PPARG recruitment to target promoters and thereby inhibiting transcriptional activation. Required for fatty acid and lipid metabolism, is involved as well in the regulation of circulating insulin levels. Plays an important role in the maintenance of cardiovascular functions through the regulation of NO and vasodilatatory prostaglandins production in aortas. Controls circadian glutamate uptake in synaptic vesicles through the regulation of VGLUT1 expression. May also be involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes.

PIP3 plays a key role by recruiting PH domain-containing proteins to the membrane, including AKT1 and PDPK1, activating signaling cascades involved in cell growth, survival, proliferation, motility and morphology. Participates in cellular signaling in response to various growth factors. Involved in the activation of AKT1 upon stimulation by receptor tyrosine kinases ligands such as EGF, insulin, IGF1, VEGFA and PDGF. Involved in signaling via insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (PubMed:20236230). Essential in endothelial cell migration during vascular development through VEGFA signaling, possibly by regulating RhoA activity. Required for lymphatic vasculature development, possibly by binding to RAS and by activation by EGF and FGF2, but not by PDGF. Regulates invadopodia formation through the PDPK1-AKT1 pathway. Participates in cardiomyogenesis in embryonic stem cells through a AKT1 pathway. Participates in vasculogenesis in embryonic stem cells through PDK1 and protein kinase C pathway.

Also activated by enkephalin peptides, such as Met-enkephalin or Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe, with higher affinity for Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe (PubMed:8624732). Agonist binding to the receptor induces coupling to an inactive GDP-bound heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer activating downstream cellular effectors (PubMed:16682964, PubMed:9224819). The agonist- and cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins, GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2, and to a lesser extent to pertussis toxin-insensitive G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15 (PubMed:9224819, PubMed:9572309). They mediate an array of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and both N-type and L-type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase (PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:15944153, PubMed:21292762, PubMed:7595566, PubMed:9572309). Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory G alpha proteins (PubMed:7595566). The selective temporal coupling to G-proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-term receptor desensitization (PubMed:11060299, PubMed:17384143, PubMed:17947509, PubMed:18558479). Beta-arrestins associate with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction. The phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins. The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation (PubMed:11278523, PubMed:11896051, PubMed:15944153). Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur dependent or independent of G-protein coupling (PubMed:11060299, PubMed:17384143, PubMed:17947509, PubMed:18558479). Endogenous ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and recycling. Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking properties (PubMed:16682964, PubMed:17384143). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11060299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11896051, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15944153, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16682964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17384143, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17947509, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1846076, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18558479, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21292762, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7595566, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7678862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8051154, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8240812, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8393525, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8624732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9224819, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9572309}."

gasAcul21603-RA,PENK,A0A1B2CTC1,infection_induced,Gy_chrXVIII,intergenic,"FUNCTION: O-methyltransferase; part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of penigequinolones, potent insecticidal alkaloids that contain a highly modified 10-carbon prenyl group (PubMed:25859931). The first stage is catalyzed by the nonribosomal peptide synthetase penN that condenses anthranilic acid and O-methyl-L-tyrosine to produce 4'-methoxycyclopeptin (By similarity). 4'-methoxycyclopeptin is then converted to 4'-methoxydehydrocyclopeptin by the ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase penM through dehydrogenation to form a double bond between C-alpha and C-beta of the O-methyltyrosine side chain (By similarity). PenM also converts its first product methoxydehydrocyclopeptin to 4'-methoxycyclopenin (By similarity). The following conversion of 4'methoxycyclopenin into 4'-methoxyviridicatin is catalyzed by the cyclopenase penL (By similarity). 4'-methoxyviridicatin is the precursor of quinolone natural products, and is further converted to quinolinone B (Probable). The prenyltransferase penI then catalyzes the canonical Friedel-Crafts alkylation of quinolinone B with dimethylallyl cation to yield dimethylallyl quinolone, which is subjected to FAD-dependent dehydrogenation by the FAD-linked oxidoreductase penH to yield conjugated aryl diene (PubMed:25859931). The delta(3') double bond then serves as the site of the second alkylation with DMAPP catalyzed by the prenyltransferase penG to yield a carbenium ion intermediate, which can be attacked by H(2)O to yield a styrenyl quinolone containing a C3'-hydroxyprenyl chain, or undergo cyclization to yield yaequinolones J1 and J2 (PubMed:25859931). The conversion of the styrenyl quinolone into the tetrahydrofuran-containing yaequinolone C is performed by the FAD-dependent monooxygenase penE and involves epoxidation of the terminal C7'-C8' olefin, followed by epoxide ring opening initiated by the C3' hydroxyl group (PubMed:25859931). The predicted cysteine hydrolase penJ acts as an epoxide hydrolase that enhances the rate of the 5-exo-tet cyclization step, increasing the yield of yaequinolone C (PubMed:25859931, PubMed:28114276). PenF catalyzes the cationic rearrangement of the epoxide formed by penE (before ring opening to produce yaequinolone C) into yaequinolone D (PubMed:28114276). Finally, the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR)-like reductase penD, catalyzes both the dehydration of yaequinolone D and the reduction of the resulting oxonium to yield penigequinolone (PubMed:28114276). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:C8VJQ3, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q5AR53, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q5AR54, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25859931, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28114276, ECO:0000305|PubMed:25859931}."

Associated with two 19S regulatory particles, forms the 26S proteasome and thus participates in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The 26S proteasome plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Associated with the PA200 or PA28, the 20S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-independent protein degradation.

Catalyzes ufmylation of many protein, such as CD274/PD-L1, CDK5RAP3, CYB5R3, DDRGK1, EIF6, histone H4, MRE11, P4HB, PDCD1/PD-1, TRIP4, RPN1, RPS20/uS10, RPL10/uL16, RPL26/uL24, SYVN1/HRD1 and TP53/p53 (By similarity). As part of the UREL complex, plays a key role in ribosome recycling by catalyzing mono-ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 subunit of the 60S ribosome (By similarity). Ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 occurs on free 60S ribosomes following ribosome dissociation: it weakens the junction between post-termination 60S subunits and SEC61 translocons, promoting release and recycling of the large ribosomal subunit from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (By similarity). Ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 and subsequent 60S ribosome recycling either take place after normal termination of translation or after ribosome stalling during cotranslational translocation at the endoplasmic reticulum (By similarity). Involved in reticulophagy in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress by mediating ufmylation of proteins such as CYB5R3 and RPN1, thereby promoting lysosomal degradation of ufmylated proteins (By similarity). Ufmylation in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress is essential for processes such as hematopoiesis, blood vessel morphogenesis or inflammatory response (PubMed:30881595). Regulates inflammation in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress by promoting reticulophagy, leading to inhibit the activity of the NF-kappa-B transcription factor (PubMed:30881595, PubMed:31078114, PubMed:31721015, PubMed:32050508). Mediates ufmylation of DDRGK1 and CDK5RAP3; the role of these modifications is however unclear: as both DDRGK1 and CDK5RAP3 act as substrate adapters for ufmylation, it is uncertain whether ufmylation of these proteins is, a collateral effect or is required for ufmylation (By similarity). Acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation by mediating ufmylation and stabilization of PDCD1/PD-1 (By similarity). Also involved in the response to DNA damage: recruited to double-strand break sites following DNA damage and mediates monoufmylation of histone H4 and ufmylation of MRE11 (By similarity).

Functions as an endoribonuclease involved in mRNA decay. Modulates the inflammatory response by promoting the degradation of a set of translationally active cytokine-induced inflammation-related mRNAs, such as IL6 and IL12B, during the early phase of inflammation. Prevents aberrant T-cell-mediated immune reaction by degradation of multiple mRNAs controlling T-cell activation, such as those encoding cytokines (IL6 and IL2), cell surface receptors (ICOS, TNFRSF4 and TNFR2) and transcription factor (REL). Inhibits cooperatively with ZC3H12A the differentiation of helper T cells Th17 in lungs. They repress target mRNA encoding the Th17 cell-promoting factors IL6, ICOS, REL, IRF4, NFKBID and NFKBIZ. The cooperation requires RNA-binding by RC3H1 and the nuclease activity of ZC3H12A (By similarity). Together with RC3H1, destabilizes TNFRSF4/OX40 mRNA by binding to the conserved stem loop structure in its 3'UTR (By similarity). Self regulates by destabilizing its own mRNA. Cleaves mRNA harboring a stem-loop (SL), often located in their 3'-UTRs, during the early phase of inflammation in a helicase UPF1-dependent manner (By similarity). Plays a role in the inhibition of microRNAs (miRNAs) biogenesis (By similarity). Cleaves the terminal loop of a set of precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) important for the regulation of the inflammatory response leading to their degradation, and thus preventing the biosynthesis of mature miRNAs (By similarity). Also plays a role in promoting angiogenesis in response to inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the production of antiangiogenic microRNAs via its anti-dicer RNase activity (By similarity). Affects the overall ubiquitination of cellular proteins. Positively regulates deubiquitinase activity promoting the cleavage at 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains on TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), preventing JNK and NF-kappa-B signaling pathway activation, and hence negatively regulating macrophage-mediated inflammatory response and immune homeostasis (By similarity). Induces also deubiquitination of the transcription factor HIF1A, probably leading to its stabilization and nuclear import, thereby positively regulating the expression of proangiogenic HIF1A-targeted genes. Involved in a TANK-dependent negative feedback response to attenuate NF-kappaB activation through the deubiquitination of IKBKG or TRAF6 in response to interleukin-1-beta (IL1B) stimulation or upon DNA damage (By similarity). Prevents stress granules (SGs) formation and promotes macrophage apoptosis under stress conditions, including arsenite-induced oxidative stress, heat shock, and energy deprivation. Plays a role in the regulation of macrophage polarization; promotes IL4-induced polarization of macrophages M1 into anti-inflammatory M2 state. May also act as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in inflammatory response, angiogenesis, adipogenesis and apoptosis (By similarity). Functions as a positive regulator of glial differentiation of neuroprogenitor cells through an amyloid precursor protein (APP)-dependent signaling pathway (By similarity). Attenuates septic myocardial contractile dysfunction in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by reducing I-kappa-B-kinase (IKK)-mediated NF-kappa-B activation, and hence myocardial pro-inflammatory cytokine production (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q5D1E7, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q5D1E8}."

Channels open or close in response to the voltage difference across the membrane, letting potassium ions pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient. Homotetrameric channels mediate a delayed-rectifier voltage-dependent outward potassium current that display rapid activation and slow inactivation in response to membrane depolarization. Can form functional homotetrameric and heterotetrameric channels that contain variable proportions of KCNB1; channel properties depend on the type of alpha subunits that are part of the channel. Can also form functional heterotetrameric channels with other alpha subunits that are non-conducting when expressed alone, such as KCNS1 and KCNS2, creating a functionally diverse range of channel complexes. In vivo, membranes probably contain a mixture of heteromeric potassium channel complexes, making it difficult to assign currents observed in intact tissues to any particular potassium channel family member.
