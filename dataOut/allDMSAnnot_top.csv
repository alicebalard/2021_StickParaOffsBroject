This encoded protein is a cis-trans prolyl isomerase that binds the immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin, as well as histone deacetylases, the transcription factor YY1, casein kinase II, and nucleolin. It has a higher affinity for rapamycin than for FK506 and thus may be an important target molecule for immunosuppression by rapamycin. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2008]"
"TRIM16","gasAcul21393-RA","Gy_chrV",13265278,13266783,1.505,NA,NA,8,NA,8,5.32,"G2","The protein encoded by this gene is a tripartite motif (TRIM) family member that contains two B box domains and a coiled-coiled region that are characteristic of the B box zinc finger protein family. While it lacks a RING domain found in other TRIM proteins, the encoded protein can homodimerize or heterodimerize with other TRIM proteins and has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This gene is also a tumor suppressor and is involved in secretory autophagy. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2017]"

This protein is expressed weakly in resting NK and T cells. The encoded protein modulates the activation of ARF genes by CYTH1. This protein interacts with CYTH1 and SNX27 proteins and may act to sequester CYTH1 protein in the cytoplasm.[provided by RefSeq, Aug 2008]"

Ligands of this family bind various TGF-beta receptors leading to recruitment and activation of SMAD family transcription factors that regulate gene expression. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate each subunit of the disulfide-linked homodimer, which plays a role in bone and cartilage development. Duplication of a regulatory region downstream of this gene causes a form of brachydactyly characterized by a malformed index finger and second toe in human patients. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2016]"
