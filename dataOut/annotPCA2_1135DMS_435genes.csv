The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the gamma chain isoform laminin, gamma 3. The gamma 3 chain is most similar to the gamma 1 chain, and contains all the 6 domains expected of the gamma chain. It is a component of laminin 12. The gamma 3 chain is broadly expressed in skin, heart, lung, and the reproductive tracts. In skin, it is seen within the basement membrane of the dermal-epidermal junction at points of nerve penetration. Gamma 3 is also a prominent element of the apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells of lung, oviduct, epididymis, ductus deferens, and seminiferous tubules.

The encoded protein regulates the activity of various transcription factors, including the androgen receptor, Smad3/4, and p53. The encoded protein may also play a role in sumoylation. A translocation between this locus on chromosome 10 and the protein tyrosine kinase ABL1 locus on chromosome 9 has been associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

"ZNF346","gasAcul06594-RA","Similar to znf346: Zinc finger protein 346 (Danio rerio OX=7955)","Gy_chrVII",0.25,"23567","zinc finger protein 346","The protein encoded by this gene is a nucleolar, zinc finger protein that preferentially binds to double-stranded (ds) RNA or RNA/DNA hybrids, rather than DNA alone. Mutational studies indicate that the zinc finger domains are not only essential for dsRNA binding, but are also required for its nucleolar localization. The encoded protein may be involved in cell growth and survival. It plays a role in protecting neurons by inhibiting cell cycle re-entry via stimulation of p21 gene expression. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2015]","G2"
