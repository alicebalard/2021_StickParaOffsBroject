Mediates oxidative-stress-induced cell death by modulating phosphorylation of JNK1-JNK2 (MAPK8 and MAPK9), p38 (MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and MAPK14) during oxidative stress. Plays a role in a staurosporine-induced caspase-independent apoptotic pathway by regulating the nuclear translocation of AIFM1 and ENDOG and the DNase activity associated with ENDOG. Phosphorylates STK38L on 'Thr-442' and stimulates its kinase activity. In association with STK26 negatively regulates Golgi reorientation in polarized cell migration upon RHO activation. Regulates also cellular migration with alteration of PTPN12 activity and PXN phosphorylation: phosphorylates PTPN12 and inhibits its activity and may regulate PXN phosphorylation through PTPN12 (By similarity). May act as a key regulator of axon regeneration in the optic nerve and radial nerve (PubMed:19855390). Part of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. STRIPAK complexes have critical roles in protein (de)phosphorylation and are regulators of multiple signaling pathways including Hippo, MAPK, nuclear receptor and cytoskeleton remodeling. Different types of STRIPAK complexes are involved in a variety of biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism and immune regulation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Y6E0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19855390}."

Upon ligand binding, translocates into the nucleus, where it heterodimerizes with ARNT and induces transcription by binding to xenobiotic response elements (XRE). Regulates a variety of biological processes, including angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, drug and lipid metabolism, cell motility and immune modulation. Xenobiotics can act as ligands: upon xenobiotic-binding, activates the expression of multiple phase I and II xenobiotic chemical metabolizing enzyme genes (such as the CYP1A1 gene). Mediates biochemical and toxic effects of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. Next to xenobiotics, natural ligands derived from plants, microbiota, and endogenous metabolism are potent AHR agonists. Tryptophan (Trp) derivatives constitute an important class of endogenous AHR ligands. Acts as a negative regulator of anti-tumor immunity: indoles and kynurenic acid generated by Trp catabolism act as ligand and activate AHR, thereby promoting AHR-driven cancer cell motility and suppressing adaptive immunity. Regulates the circadian clock by inhibiting the basal and circadian expression of the core circadian component PER1. Inhibits PER1 by repressing the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer mediated transcriptional activation of PER1. The heterodimer ARNT:AHR binds to core DNA sequence 5'-TGCGTG-3' within the dioxin response element (DRE) of target gene promoters and activates their transcription (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P35869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9022676}."
